# Air Quality Prediction Model for Medellin, Colombia

## Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts air quality measurements for a specific sensor location in Medellin, Colombia. The model is designed to serve as a backup or replacement for the physical sensor, offering a cost-effective solution for continuous air quality monitoring.

## Objectives

1. **Data Collection**: Utilize air quality data from OpenAQ, specifically focusing on sensors located in Medellin.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the collected data to understand the patterns and distributions of air quality indicators.
3. **Model Development**: Build a predictive model using data from nearby sensors to estimate the measurements for the target sensor location.
4. **Implementation**: Deploy the model as a service, providing real-time predictions to serve as a backup for the physical sensor.

## Data Source

The data is sourced from [OpenAQ](https://openaq.org/), which provides access to air quality data collected from sensors around the world. For this project, data from sensors in Medellin will be utilized.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Identifying and creating relevant features for the model.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: Training various machine learning models and evaluating their performance.
4. **Deployment**: Setting up the model for real-time prediction and integration with existing systems.

## Potential Impact

By providing accurate air quality predictions, this model can help local authorities and residents make informed decisions about environmental and public health. Additionally, it can serve as a cost-effective alternative for air quality monitoring in areas where deploying physical sensors is not feasible.
